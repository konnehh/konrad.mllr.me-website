                <h2>Why Linux?</h2>
                <p>
                    I started my career as an administrator of mixed Windows and Linux infrastructure while working my apprenticeship in Stuttgart.
                    Originally I had planned to learn mostly about the Windows world and build computers and help people use them.
                    While my Linux journey started out as simple attempts to host a websites and services for me and my friends to use, I quickly learned to enjoy a simple fact:
                    Linux talks.
                    It may speak a complicated language, but it talks. 
                    It was hard for me to get Linux to work at first. As it turns out, that was not the fault of Linux: It did exactly what I told it to do, and often I gave it incomplete or wrong information.
                    Using Linux is an exercise in understanding what you tell your system, and trying to listen to what it tells you. I urge you to try it!

                <p>I like to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>walk, train and play with my dog - being a dog owner is very gratifying &#8594;</li>
                    <li>like many people my age, I enjoy video games. If you play fighting games, let's run some sets.</li>
                    <li>I've been learning to play guitar and make music for a while now, and it's fun</li>
                    <li>I play volleyball in a mixed team</li>
